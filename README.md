# Link Card Customization

This project is based off of the [Card by Smit-Prajapati](https://uiverse.io/Smit-Prajapati/massive-insect-5) available from [UIverse](https://uiverse.io/)
You can view my customized version [here](https://katemcro.github.io/linkCard/).

## Purpose

The intention behind this project is to explore and learn new techniques by customizing components that capture my interest and integrating them seamlessly with my personal aesthetic.

## Features

- Customization: The project showcases personalized modifications made to the original card design, this includes making the starting button much smaller and having it grow.
- Aesthetic Integration: The card has been updated to fit with my personal brand's theme.

## Getting Started
